                Over the past five years, we've created nearly 300 videos on sexual health,
                enjoyment, and history. The channel just passed the half-million subscriber
                mark earlier this year and all of this is in no small part thanks to you --
                fans who value comprehensive sex education and those of you who also have
                the ability to provide financial backing so that we keep the show free for
                as large of a viewing platform as possible.

                This is a big journey, Doe-Nation and there are a ton of questions. Here are a
                few that we’ve heard, we’ll sure there will be many more!
            </div>

            <div class="home__faq-question">
                Q01: What are you doing on this trip?  What are your goals?
            </div>
            <div class="home__faq-answer">
                A01: AWESOME QUESTION! We’re going around the country to set up presentations
                and answer whatever sex-related questions we can. We are hoping to focus on
                communities that might not have the availability of online platforms or
                well-structured school curriculums, as they inherently have the most to benefit.
            </div>

            <div class="home__faq-question">
                Q02: When will this trip happen?
            </div>
            <div class="home__faq-answer">
                A02: GLAD YOU ASKED! Our current goal is to start this tour in early December
                and keep it going through March or even longer.
            </div>

            <div class="home__faq-question">
                Q03: Where do you plan on going?
            </div>
            <div class="home__faq-answer">
                A03: ANOTHER GREAT QUESTION! By supporting this project, you will get to
                nominate (not one, but) two locations for the tour to stop. During the planning
                stages of the tour, all the nominations will be tallied to plan the most
                geographically inclusive tour possible.

                Q06: What kinds of perks are available for supporting the tour?
            </div>
            <div class="home__faq-answer">
                A06: YOUR CURIOSITY IS FABULOUS! Firstly, everyone who supports the tour gets
                to nominate two tour stops. This is ensure the trip is not isolated to just
                those communities that provide support. Keep in mind that none of the
                following lists are complete. Physical perks include postcards, certificates,
                and artwork. Digital perks include access to blogs, vlogs, and livestreams.
                Altruistic perks include providing food, gas, laundry and showers for the
                travellers. Donor-level perks include naming sperm on the RV, naming the RV
                itself, and naming the website. There will also be some Meatus (“Meet Us”)
                perks, too. Check out all the links above for more!

                Q07: Are my contributions tax-deductible?
            </div>
            <div class="home__faq-answer">
                A07: Contributions made before November 28, 2019 are tax-deductible through our
                former fiscal sponsor; donors will receive tax receipts on or before January 31,
                2020. Contributions made after November 28, 2019 are not tax-deductible.

            <div class="home__faq-answer">
