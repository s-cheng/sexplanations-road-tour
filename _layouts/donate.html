                        donation will help us reach communities and people who don’t have access
                        to sex education, and can make the world a happier place.

                        Sexplanations Road Tour has partnered with the Effing Foundation,
                        a 501c3, non-profit so all of your contributions to the project can go
                        toward a tax break.

                        Plus, Effing Foundation’s mission is to increase public knowledge of
                        human sexuality and sex-positivity, and promote sexual literacy, health,
                        and wellness worldwide so... we’re practically best friends and I want
